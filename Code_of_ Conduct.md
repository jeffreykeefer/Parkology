# Parkology Code of Conduct

## Purpose
Together, we can support communities to improve their local green spaces and increase access to quality, close to home parks. We commit to making participation in Parkology a respectful and inclusive space for everyone, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, national origin, ancestry, ethnicity, veteran status, or level of experience. The aim of this code of conduct is to outline expected behaviors and provide recourse in case of moderation.

### Our Community Members Strive to:
- Use welcoming, patient, and inclusive language
- Respect differing points of view and experiences
- Collaborate openly for the benefit of all


### Moderation
Parkology moderators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take fair, corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. This may include right and responsibility to remove, edit, or limit comments and other contributions that are not aligned to this code of conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
